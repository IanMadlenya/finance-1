# Xethron Finance

Gain insight into your finance.

## Idea
 * Import transaction history from bank
 * Group transactions by "vendor"
 * Add purchases, ether cash or linked to a transaction
 * Add products linked to purchase
 * Report on data

## Reports
Reports should show where money is being spent, and easily "group" data together.

Also, as a side project, report on different prices for similar products based on brand and "vendor".
